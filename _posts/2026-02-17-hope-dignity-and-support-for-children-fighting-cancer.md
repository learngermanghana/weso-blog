## A Child’s Fight Should Not Be Faced Alone

Childhood cancer affects more than health.  
It disrupts school, strains family finances, and creates deep emotional stress for both children and parents.  
Many families in Ghana face this journey without enough information, support, or resources.

At **Wesoamo Child Cancer Foundation**, we believe every child deserves dignity, comfort, and hope throughout treatment—and every parent deserves guidance and emotional support.

## What We Do

Our work focuses on three main pillars: **awareness, welfare support, and counselling**.

### Childhood Cancer Awareness
We educate communities about early warning signs and encourage timely medical care.  
Through outreach and partnerships, we help families recognize symptoms early and seek help before it is too late.

### Financial and Welfare Support
Cancer treatment can create heavy financial pressure.  
We provide practical assistance to families in treatment, including:
- Transport support
- Emergency welfare assistance
- Essential needs for children in hospital

### Parent Counselling and Emotional Support
A diagnosis can be overwhelming for parents.  
We offer counselling, emotional check-ins, and guidance—especially in difficult or terminal cases—so no parent faces the journey alone.

## Supporting Children Beyond Treatment

Our mission continues even after treatment ends.

### Survivor Follow-Up
We stay connected with survivors to encourage healing, confidence, and reintegration into daily life.

### Hospital Child Welfare Projects
We support child-friendly spaces in hospitals, including:
- Library corners
- Learning materials
- Playroom support
- Comfort items for long hospital stays

## Our Promise

We are committed to:
- Compassionate, child-first support
- Respect for privacy and dignity
- Transparent updates on projects
- Collaboration with communities and partners
