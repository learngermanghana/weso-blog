## Why Early Detection Matters

Childhood cancer is not very common, but when it happens, **early detection can make a life-saving difference**.  
Many symptoms may look like common childhood illnesses, which is why awareness is so important.

In Ghana, some families reach the hospital late because the early warning signs were not recognized.  
Knowing what to look for can help parents seek medical care sooner.

## Common Early Signs of Childhood Cancer

Not every symptom means cancer, but **persistent or unusual changes** should always be checked by a doctor.

### 1) Unexplained Weight Loss
If a child suddenly loses weight without a clear reason, it could be a warning sign.

### 2) Constant Fatigue or Weakness
Children who are always tired, pale, or less active than usual may need medical attention.

### 3) Frequent Fever or Infections
Repeated fevers or infections that do not improve with treatment can be a concern.

### 4) Unusual Lumps or Swelling
Swelling in the neck, abdomen, chest, or underarms should be checked, especially if it does not go away.

### 5) Persistent Bone or Joint Pain
Ongoing pain that affects walking, playing, or sleeping should not be ignored.

### 6) Easy Bruising or Bleeding
Frequent nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or unusual bruises may be a sign of blood-related conditions.

### 7) Headaches with Vomiting
Severe or frequent headaches, especially with early-morning vomiting, should be evaluated.

### 8) Changes in the Eyes or Vision
White spots in the eyes, sudden vision problems, or unusual eye swelling require urgent attention.

## When Should Parents See a Doctor?

You should seek medical advice if:

- A symptom lasts more than **two weeks**
- Symptoms keep returning
- The child’s condition is getting worse
- You feel something is not normal

**Trust your instincts as a parent.** It is always better to check early.
